We used some of the code in this AI React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial.

[React AI Tic-Tac-Toe](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-i-created-my-first-ai-program-using-react-js-95fe54d994d6)

We read this article to learn more about React AI.

We ran into a package.json problem where I needed to remove "not dead" from the dependencies.
